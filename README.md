# UAV-MinimumSeparation
This website hosts the case study we have developed for dynamically computing minimum separation distance between small Uncrewed Aircraft. It is part of our ongoing Drone Response project, in which we have designed and implemented a multi-sUAS system to support diverse tasks, including Search and Rescue (SAR). You can find a short video describing Drone Response [here](https://youtu.be/DyKqxkesgg0).
